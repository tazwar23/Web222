                    <p style="text-align:justify">The term "Responsive Web Design" refers to the practice of creating websites that adapt to the device they're being viewed on to give consumers with a smooth, ideal experience. Fluid grids, responsive media, and media queries are the three primary ideas of responsive web design.<br><br>
                    Mobile users are gaining ground, and businesses must optimize their websites for all platforms to compete in the emerging mobile-dominated internet world. RWD websites just have one URL and one set of code, so there's no need to develop several websites or worry about various URLs; the user will see the same site whether they're on a tablet, a smartphone, or a laptop. And the website will resize and reorganize itself to fit the screen of the device being used to see it. With RWD, your website will look great on any device.<br><br>
                    Not only that, but it will also save you money in terms of web design and administration. Only one website must be designed, and only one website needs to be managed. Moreover, RWD creates the most seamless, high-quality experience you can give consumers who are likely to visit your site on various devices. When it comes to RWD, the advantages much outnumber the disadvantages.</p><br>

                    <p style="text-align:justify">I've always been fascinated with programming, which is why I opted to enroll in this program at Seneca. Before entering this course, I knew very little about web development and had no idea what to anticipate. But I'm delighted I was able to enroll in this course. Web development piqued my curiosity. I can understand how valuable this web building skill may be today. I believe that the knowledge I received from the course assisted me in developing perspective, and now when I visit a website, I attempt to figure out how it was designed by inspecting the elements on the browser. I am really happy with the outcome. </p>
